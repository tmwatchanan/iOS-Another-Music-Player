I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be When we were younger and free I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet There's such a difference between us And a million miles \n\n Hello from the other side I must've called a thousand times to tell you I'm sorry, for everything that I've done But when I call you never seem to be home \n\n Hello from the outside At least I can say that I've tried to tell you I'm sorry, for breaking your heart But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore \n\n Hello, how are you? It's so typical of me to talk about myself I'm sorry, I hope that you're well Did you ever make it out of that town Where nothing ever happened? It's no secret That the both of us are running out of time \n\n Hello from the other side I must've called a thousand times to tell you I'm sorry, for everything that I've done But when I call you never seem to be home \n\n Hello from the outside At least I can say that I've tried to tell you I'm sorry, for breaking your heart But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore \n\n Ooooohh, anymore \n Ooooohh, anymore \n Ooooohh, anymore \n Anymore \n\n Hello from the other side I must've called a thousand times to tell you I'm sorry, for everything that I've done But when I call you never seem to be home \n\n Hello from the outside At least I can say that I've tried to tell you I'm sorry, for breaking your heart But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore"
